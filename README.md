# Dinosaur Run
This map is created to showcase a 5-mile run that is as much a challenge as aesthetically appealing to show off on Strava

## How I made this

A GPX file of the run was recorded utilizing a Garmin Forerunner 230. This was then uploaded and downloaded from Strava.

Utilizing GeoJson.io, I turned the GPX file into a GeoJSON and added placemarkers at various points on the route.

Leaflet services were used to create a basemap
