# Dinsosaur Run
This map is created to showcase a 5 mile run that is both a challenge as much as it aesthethically appealing to run

A GPX file of the run was recorded utilzing a Garmin Forerunner 230. This was then uploaded and downloaded from Strava.

Utilizing GeoJson.io I turned the GPX file into a GeoJSON and added placemarkers along various points on the route.

Leaflet services were used to create a basemap
